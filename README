UnityHeapEx is a managed heap snapshot tool for Unity3D. It works by gathering all
managed references in your game and then traversing the whole object hierarchy and dumping it into an xml file. By inspecting this file, you can get a pretty good idea
of what is there in memory and find any memory leaks you might be having. Check out [exampledump.xml](exampledump.xml) to see what output looks like.

Usage

Just drop the files into your Editor folder inside the project, and a new menu item Tools->Memory->Heap Dump should appear. The path to the created dump file will be piped to the console.

History

UnityHeapEx has been originally created in Mail.Ru Games and was used to find
memory leaks in Allods Adventure game. This fork rewrites parts to reduce dump file size and leans towards reporting memory usage rather than leaks.
